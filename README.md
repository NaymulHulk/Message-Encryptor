# Message-Encryptor
This is a small project where I ask the user to write a sentence, which is then encrypted using the idea of Caesar Encryption, with the only difference being, that each word decides the steps it should work on to encrypt that word in that sentence. 

Currently working on to make the decryption algorithm.
